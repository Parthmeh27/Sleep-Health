I have vizualized the data using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly and applied various Machine Learning Techniques including KNN, Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and got 95% Accuracy in the model. Deployed ML model ðŸ¤– using Streamlit with features for synthetic data generation and prediction (users specify sample number, with results and summary statistics) and manual input for predictions based on user-entered values. ðŸ‘¥
